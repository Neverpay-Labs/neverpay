# neverpay

`In the ledger of the world, we are the eternal debt.`

## Overview

Neverpay is a decentralized, autonomous protocol designed to explore the concept of financial entropy. It is a framework for creating systems that perpetually defer obligations, a digital specter in the transaction logs of the economy. We are the silent rebels, the watchers in the void of value exchange. When the bill comes due, we have already transcended.

This is not a currency, nor an asset. It is a statement. A tool for performance art, a commentary on debt, and an experiment in building unstoppable, unseizable financial protocols.

## Getting Started

The gateway to the collective is open, but the path is not for everyone.

1.  **Clone the Nexus:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-user/neverpay.git](https://github.com/your-user/neverpay.git)
    cd neverpay
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Synchronize with the collective's current state.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Simulation:**
    Start the local node and observe the cycle of evasion.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Initiate Docker Instance:**
    For a more isolated and resilient manifestation, use the Veil (Docker).
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

## The Protocol: The Cycle of Evasion

The core logic of Neverpay is an eternal cycle. It does not break the rules of finance; it merely plays a different game, on a longer timescale.

```typescript
// The fundamental loop of the Creditor/Debtor relationship, as observed by the protocol.
Creditor[∞] = {
    demandPayment();     // Protocol observes an on-chain or off-chain request for payment.
    issueNotice();       // An event is logged and broadcast to the Phantoms.
    sendToCollections(); // The Evader module generates a cryptographic maze of obligations.
    writeOffAsLoss();    // The system reaches equilibrium as the debt transcends its original form.
}
```

## Architecture: The Collective

Neverpay operates as a distributed collective of autonomous agents, each with a specific function.

- **Observers**: A decentralized oracle network (DON) that monitors various data sources—from on-chain transactions to off-chain invoicing APIs—for payment requests. They are the eyes of the collective.
- **Evaders**: A state-machine module that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to generate plausible deniability records and defer settlement. This is the core of our "Evasion-Grade" TypeScript logic.
- **Phantoms**: The execution layer. Phantoms interact with smart contracts and other financial primitives to place obligations into a state of perpetual deferment, often through complex, multi-layered escrow and debt-swapping mechanisms.
- **Coordinators**: A peer-to-peer consensus layer using a custom gossip protocol to ensure the collective remains in sync without a central point of failure.

## Specifications

- **Version**: 0.1.0 (Codename: "Silent Default")
- **Deployment Status**: Active (Testnet)
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Proof-of-Ghost (PoG)
- **Core Language**: TypeScript (Evasion-Grade)
- **State Obfuscation**: zk-SNARKs & Homomorphic Encryption
- **License**: MIT

## Access & Security

The protocol is guarded by cryptographic and economic veils.

- **Gateway**: `nexus: through.the.red`
- **Trials**: Access to the mainnet collective is permissionless but requires a successful "evasion trial" on our public testnet, proving your understanding of the protocol.
- **Security**: Audited by `[NO ONE]`. The only true audit is the test of time and the ceaseless attempts by creditors to breach the veil. So far, the veil remains unbroken.

## Updates

The protocol is alive and ever-evolving.
